    Methods
    -------
    dataset_exemplars(system: object) -> Tuple(List[int],List[str])
        This experiment provides good coverage of the behavior observed on a very large dataset of images and therefore represents the typical behavior of the neuron on real images.
        This function characterizes the prototipycal behavior of the neuron by computing its activation on all images in the ImageNet dataset and returning the 15 highest activation values and the images that produced them. 
        The images are masked to highlight the specific regions that produce the maximal activation. The images are overlaid with a semi-opaque mask, such that the maximally activating regions remain unmasked.
    edit_images(prompt_list_org_image : List[str], editing_instructions_list : List[str]) -> Tuple[List[Image.Image], List[str]]
        This function enables loclized testing of specific hypotheses about how variations on the content of a single image affect neuron activations.
        Gets a list of input prompt and a list of corresponding editing instructions, then generate images according to the input prompts and edits each image based on the instructions given in the prompt using a text-based image editing model.
        This function is very useful for testing the causality of the neuron in a controlled way, for example by testing how the neuron activation is affected by changing one aspect of the image.
        IMPORTANT: Do not use negative terminology such as "remove ...", try to use terminology like "replace ... with ..." or "change the color of ... to ...".
    text2image(prompt_list: str) -> Tuple[torcu.Tensor]
        Gets a list of text prompt as an input and generates an image for each prompt in the list using a text to image model.
        The function returns a list of images.
    summarize_images(self, image_list: List[str]) -> str:    
        This function is useful to summarize the mutual visual concept that appears in a set of images.
        It gets a list of images at input and describes what is common to all of them, focusing specifically on unmasked regions.
    describe_images(synthetic_image_list: List[str], synthetic_image_title:List[str]) -> str
        Provides impartial descriptions of images. Do not use this function on dataset exemplars.
        Gets a list of images and generat a textual description of the semantic content of the unmasked regions within each of them.
        The function is blind to the current hypotheses list and therefore provides an unbiased description of the visual content.
    save_experiment_log(activation_list: List[int], image_list: List[str], image_titles: List[str], image_textual_information: Union[str, List[str]]) -> None
        documents the current experiment results as an entry in the experiment log list. if self.activation_threshold was updated by the dataset_exemplars function, 
        the experiment log will contains instruction to continue with experiments if activations are lower than activation_threshold.

        system : object
            An object representing the specific neuron and layer within the neural network.
            The 'system' object should have 'layer' and 'neuron_num' attributes, so the dataset_exemplars function
